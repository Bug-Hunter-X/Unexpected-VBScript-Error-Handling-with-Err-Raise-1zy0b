This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in VBScript's error handling using `Err.Raise`. The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` provides a corrected version. The issue revolves around how `Err.Raise` interacts with calling functions and the importance of proper error handling.
